1.1
Can`t change the const values.
1.2
Don`t use var due to block and functional scope issues,always use const and let for variable assigning.
You can assign variable without using const,let or var but it is a bad practice.
let doesn`t allow to change value whereas var lets you to change.   
If you want to show all thew values of the variables assigned use console.table([use the variable name])
If you just declare/create a variable and don`t assign any value to it,still it`ll consume the memory space and give output as undefined.
Refer mdn documentation for postfix and prefix increments.
js ignores which datatype is being compared to,ex:Str to Number.

[1.1]


Don`t use var due to block and functional scope issues,always use const and let for variable assigning.
You can assign variable without using const,let or var but it is a bad practice.
let doesn`t allow to change value whereas var lets you to change.   
If you want to show all thew values of the variables assigned use console.table([use the variable name])
If you just declare/create a variable and don`t assign any value to it,still it`ll consume the memory space and give output as undefined.
Refer mdn documentation for postfix and prefix increments.
js ignores which datatype is being compared to,ex:Str to Number.
[1.2]


Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.
The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
JavaScript is Case Sensitive.
Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use
Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
When using const you can change the value(array) but you can`t reassign the values
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
[1.3]


Accessing Object Properties

objectName.propertyName
          or
objectName["propertyName"]

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object.
\'	'	Single quote
\"	"	Double quote
\\	\	Backslash
\b	Backspace
\f	Form Feed
\n	New Line
\r	Carriage Return
\t	Horizontal Tabulator
\v	Vertical Tabulator
You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash
The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
New keyword creates objects.

[1.4]
string methods

str.length()
str.slice(strt pt,end pt)
str.substring(strt pt,end pt) it doesn`t take negative values,it treats it as 0.
str.substr(strt pt, length )  [refer w3schools]
By default, the replace() method replaces only the first match. syntax[str.reaplce()]
    to avoid case sensitiveness use /str to be replaced/i.
    to replace globally from a particular sentence use /str to be replaced/g.
    we can us gi for global + case insesitiveness.
RepalceAll() : str.replaceall()
str.toUppercase() 
str.toLowercase()
Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
str.trim() : removes space from both ends.
    trimStart() : to remove space from beginning.
    trimEnd() : to remove space from ending.
The padStart() method pads a string from the start.
It pads a string with another string (multiple times) until it reaches a given length.
str.padStart()
The padEnd() method pads a string from the end.
It pads a string with another string (multiple times) until it reaches a given length.
str.padEnd()

The padEnd() and padStart() method is a string method.
To pad a number, convert the number to a string first.

The charAt(0) method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string
The indexOf() method returns the index (position) the first occurrence of a string in a string
The lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string
Both indexOf(), and lastIndexOf() return -1 if the text is not found
Both methods accept a second parameter as the starting position for the search
ex : text.indexOf("tiger",15)
The lastIndexOf() methods searches backwards (from the end to the beginning), meaning: if the second parameter is 15, the search starts at position 15, and searches to the beginning of the string.
The search() method searches a string for a string (or a regular expression) and returns the position of the match.
search() and index() do look and work almost same but the two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).

The match() method returns an array containing the results of matching a string against a string (or a regular expression).
Note:  do refer w3schools.
The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified value.
Otherwise it returns false.
we can add parameter too,ex: text.includes("End",12)
start looking for End from 12th index.
The startsWith() method returns true if a string begins with a specified value. ex:str.startsWith()
we can add a starting pt parameter too, so that it starts to look for the specified string from that position.
The endsWith() method returns true if a string ends with a specified value.

string interpolation

let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;
${} is used to fetch values of declared & assigned variables.

[1.6]
Numbers
JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y;
Except (+) everyother operation the strings are converted to numbers.
NaN and infinity both are number types.
Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.objects are assigned and compared by reference, not by value.
JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits.

[1.7]
BigInt

To declare a number as bigint just add 'n' at the end of the number or use BigInt(number).
Arithmetic between a BigInt and a Number is not allowed (type conversion lose information).
You can do all the operations on bigint like you used in numbers DT.
A BigInt can not have decimals.

[1.8]
Number methods

toString() : to convert number to a string.
toExponential() : to convert number to a Exponential,can alse add a parameter,ex: 9.626.toExponential(2) so that it takes only 2 decimal places.
toFixed() : it returns a STRING with the specified decimal places,ex: 9.5645.toFixed(2) = 9.56
toPrecision() returns a string, with a number written with a specified length.

To convert a variable to Number:
Number() : used for variables
parseInt() : used for strings and returns whole number.
parseFloat() :  used for strings and returns number.

Those which can`t be converted are defined as NaN

Method	                        Description
Number.isInteger()	            Returns true if the argument is an integer
Number.isSafeInteger()	        Returns true if the argument is a safe integer
Number.parseFloat()	            Converts a string to a number (spaces are allowed.)
Number.parseInt()	            Converts a string to a whole number (spaces are allowed.)
The number methods above belong to the JavaScript Number Object.

JS ARRAYS
Typeof arrays is : object.
Can access array elements by using indexes array[index].
Can change the existing elements of array thru array[indice].
Change a array to a string array.toString().


[1.10]

Array Methods

array.length() : returns the length of the array.
array.push() : add new elements at the end of the array.
            Or
array[array.length] = "desired element name" : thru this too we can add element in array.(index concept).
Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array: ex-

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits[6] = "Lemon";  // Creates undefined "holes" in fruits

array[3,4,5] will be undefined.
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

Avoid using new Array() to create arrays as it can give unexpected results,ex : it doesn`t create a single element array.
As JS recognized Array as object,so we can use Array.isArray() to check if it`s an array.
The instanceof operator returns true if an object is created by a given constructor. syntax: fruits instanceof Array.

Array.join("*") ; it works same as Array.toString(){it converts an array to a string but with a specific parameter}.
Array.pop() : removes the last element from the array.
Array.shift() : Shifting is equivalent to popping, but working on the first element instead of the last.
